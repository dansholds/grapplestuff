          Weight cutting is an important element of combat sports, despite the taboo. With Jiu Jitsu, people will cut body Weight
           and buy lightweight Gi's but they fail to address the fact that they can be carrying up to 300g of belt around their waist.
           LYTE Belts was created to manfacture lightweight belts, with our A3 belts coming in at 180gs.
